# KYM: Know Your Money

It will be a web-based application to help users monitor and manage their finances.
It would allow users to record expenses across different categories, and attempts to provide overview of their spending habits. We are planning to build the interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and offer a user-friendly dashboard where individuals can visualize expenses. We will also try to provide report generating options for monthly or yearly expenses and analyze patterns to better budget their income.
